PROJECT GOALS
---

Predicting whether a player will be eligible to play professionally or not and then comparing Machine Learning Models and deciding which to use, and doing a few Feature engineering and Hyperparameter tuning to improve the chosen model.

## Conclusion
Decision Tree is the ideal model to classify potential players after being tuned with RFE, SMOTE (because of data imbalance), and cross validatons.
